# Guessing Game

The HTML and CSS is already made.

Create a guessing game in the browser where the user can:

1. Input a number between 1 and 100 to guess.
2. The computer creates the number to be guessed.
3. Try numbers until they reach the correct one.
4. Start a new game.

The layout should update while the user inputs numbers in the following ways:

1. A prompt will come up saying if their guess was too low or too high.
2. A prompt will come up congratulating them on their successful guess, plus it will say how many guesses it took.

The new game button will not refresh the page. It will reset the prompt to 'Guess a number between 0 and 100' and change the number to be guessed.
